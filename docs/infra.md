# Qenergyz Infrastructure Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive information about the Qenergyz infrastructure, including cloud architecture, deployment strategies, and operational procedures.

## Architecture

### Multi-Cloud Support

Qenergyz supports deployment across three major cloud providers:

- **AWS**: Primary production environment
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Secondary/disaster recovery
- **Microsoft Azure**: Regional compliance requirements

### Infrastructure Components

#### Networking
- **VPC/VNet**: Isolated network environment with public and private subnets
- **Load Balancers**: Application Load Balancer (AWS ALB) for traffic distribution
- **Security Groups**: Network-level security controls
- **NAT Gateways**: Secure outbound internet access for private subnets

#### Compute Resources
- **Container Orchestration**: ECS (AWS), GKE (GCP), AKS (Azure)
- **Auto Scaling**: Horizontal and vertical scaling based on metrics
- **Load Balancing**: Multi-AZ deployment for high availability

#### Data Storage
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL (RDS/Cloud SQL/Azure Database)
- **Cache**: Redis (ElastiCache/Memorystore/Azure Cache)
- **Object Storage**: S3/Cloud Storage/Blob Storage
- **Backup Strategy**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery

#### Security
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager/Secret Manager/Key Vault
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for all data
- **Network Security**: Private subnets, security groups, NACLs
- **IAM**: Least-privilege access control

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Metrics**: CloudWatch/Stackdriver/Azure Monitor
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with retention policies
- **APM**: Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring
- **Alerting**: Multi-channel alerting (email, Slack, PagerDuty)

## Environments

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation
- **Resources**: Smaller instance sizes, reduced redundancy
- **Data**: Anonymized production data or synthetic test data
- **Access**: Development team and QA

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live customer-facing application
- **Resources**: High-availability, multi-AZ deployment
- **Data**: Live customer data with full backup and disaster recovery
- **Access**: Limited to operations team and authorized personnel

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Terraform Modules

#### Networking Module
```hcl
module "networking" {
  source = "../modules/networking"
  
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  environment    = var.environment
  vpc_cidr       = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

#### Database Module
```hcl
module "database" {
  source = "../modules/database"
  
  cloud_provider     = "aws"
  environment        = var.environment
  db_instance_class  = "db.r5.xlarge"
  backup_retention   = 30
}
```

#### Secrets Module
```hcl
module "secrets" {
  source = "../modules/secrets"
  
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  environment    = var.environment
  secrets = {
    db_password    = var.db_password
    jwt_secret     = random_password.jwt.result
    api_keys       = var.api_keys
  }
}
```

### State Management
- **Backend**: S3 with DynamoDB locking (AWS)
- **Encryption**: State files are encrypted at rest
- **Access Control**: Limited to infrastructure team
- **Versioning**: All state changes are versioned and tracked

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

1. **Network Security**
   - VPC with private subnets
   - Security groups and NACLs
   - WAF for application protection

2. **Application Security**
   - Container scanning before deployment
   - Runtime security monitoring
   - OWASP top 10 protection

3. **Data Security**
   - Encryption at rest and in transit
   - Database-level encryption
   - Secrets rotation

4. **Access Control**
   - Multi-factor authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Audit logging

### Compliance

- **SOC 2 Type II**: In progress
- **ISO 27001**: Planning phase
- **GDPR**: Implemented
- **Regional Compliance**: Sharia, CFTC, FCA requirements

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **Application Data**: Continuous replication to secondary region
- **Configuration**: Infrastructure code in version control
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour

### Multi-Region Deployment
- **Primary Region**: us-east-1 (AWS), us-central1 (GCP)
- **Secondary Region**: us-west-2 (AWS), europe-west1 (GCP)
- **Failover**: Automated DNS failover with health checks
- **Data Synchronization**: Cross-region replication

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy
- **Application Cache**: Redis with cluster mode
- **CDN**: CloudFront/Cloud CDN for static assets
- **Database Cache**: Query result caching
- **API Gateway**: Response caching for read-heavy endpoints

### Auto Scaling
- **Horizontal Scaling**: CPU and memory-based scaling
- **Vertical Scaling**: Scheduled scaling for known traffic patterns
- **Database Scaling**: Read replicas for query distribution
- **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances for non-critical workloads

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- **Application Performance**: Response time, throughput, error rate
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Business Metrics**: Active users, transaction volume, revenue
- **Security**: Failed login attempts, unusual access patterns

### Alert Thresholds
- **Critical**: Immediate response required (PagerDuty)
- **Warning**: Business hours response (Slack/Email)
- **Info**: Logged for analysis

### Dashboards
- **Operations Dashboard**: Real-time system health
- **Business Dashboard**: KPI and revenue metrics
- **Security Dashboard**: Threat detection and response

## Cost Management

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Reserved Instances**: 1-3 year commitments for predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances**: For batch processing and development environments
- **Auto Shutdown**: Development environments shut down after hours
- **Resource Tagging**: Comprehensive cost allocation

### Budget Controls
- **Monthly Budgets**: Environment-specific budget alerts
- **Cost Anomaly Detection**: Automated alerts for unusual spending
- **Regular Reviews**: Weekly cost optimization reviews

## Operational Procedures

### Deployment Process
1. Code review and approval
2. Automated testing pipeline
3. Security scanning
4. Staging deployment and testing
5. Production deployment with rollback capability

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Response**: On-call engineer notification
3. **Assessment**: Impact analysis and severity classification
4. **Resolution**: Fix implementation with communication
5. **Post-mortem**: Root cause analysis and prevention

### Maintenance Windows
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: First Sunday of each month, 2-6 AM UTC
- **Emergency Maintenance**: As needed with stakeholder notification
- **Database Maintenance**: Monthly during low-traffic periods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### High CPU Usage
```bash
# Check ECS/EKS service metrics
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics \
  --namespace AWS/ECS \
  --metric-name CPUUtilization \
  --dimensions Name=ServiceName,Value=qenergyz-backend
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check RDS instance status
aws rds describe-db-instances \
  --db-instance-identifier qenergyz-production-db
```

#### Application Errors
```bash
# Check application logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /ecs/qenergyz-production \
  --filter-pattern "ERROR"
```
